# I predict that it would ask the user to input the length.
# It will then output The area of a square of side length (length the user entered) is: (result of entered number to the power of 2)

# Run, my predcition was correct
import math
length = input("Please input a length: ")
length = float(length) # then it wassign the variable "length" the number as a floating pint
area = math.pow(length, 2) # squared the number (power of 2)
print("The area of a square of side length", length, "is:", area) # prints the statement

# It stops execution after the program is done, and the statement is printed then it wassign the variable "length" the number as a floating pint 
# # For example, I input 5, then 5 will be raised to the power of two, whcih is 25, and that did match my result from the calculator
# Modify
import math
radius = input("Please input the radius of the circle: ") # user input
radius = float(radius)
# Makes the input number to a floating number
area = 0.5*math.pi*math.pow(radius, 2) + 4*math.pow(radius, 2) # calculates the area
print("area is:", area)# prints the final answer answer of the area as a float
# radius is multiplied by 2 because you need the diameter/length where radius is only half of that
