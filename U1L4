num = input("Please input a whole number: ") # this will ask the user to enter a number

num2 = num / 6 # divides the number by 6, which will be stored in the num2
print("When", num, " is divided by 6, the result is:", num2) # prints the answer

num3 = input("Use any whole number except zero: ")
num3 = int(num3)# this will make the whole number entered into an integer, initially it was a string
print("When", num3, " is divided by 6, the result is:", num3/6) # prints the answer
